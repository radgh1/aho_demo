            "### Core Components:\n\n"
            "**1. Hierarchical Uncertainty Quantifier (HUQ):**\n"
            "- Computes individual confidence scores for both human experts and AI classifier\n"
            "- Uses calibrated, task-specific uncertainty proxies (entropy for AI, consistency across experts for humans)\n"
            "- Encodes expert decisions as probabilistic outputs via calibration (Platt scaling)\n"
            "- Computes inter-expert disagreement via Jensen-Shannon divergence\n"
            "- Combines AI uncertainty (Monte Carlo dropout/ensemble variance) with human disagreement\n"
            "- Fuses modalities via learnable weighted sum into unified [0,1] uncertainty score\n\n"
            "**2. Workload Scheduler:**\n"
            "- Uses uncertainty score as decision threshold: route to humans if uncertainty > τ(t)\n"
            "- τ(t) updated via contextual bandit with linear function approximator\n"
            "- State includes: coverage, accuracy trend, expert workload, uncertainty distribution\n"
            "- Reward: R = α·Accuracy + (1−α)·Coverage − λ·WorkloadBalancePenalty\n\n"
            "### Key Features:\n"
            "- **Dynamic Adaptation**: τ(t) evolves via reinforcement learning, not fixed thresholds\n"
            "- **Pareto Optimization**: Balances coverage-accuracy trade-offs autonomously\n"
            "- **Fatigue Modeling**: Accounts for expert performance degradation over time\n"
            "- **Workload Balancing**: Penalizes imbalanced expert utilization\n"
            "- **Multi-Task Support**: Radiology, legal, and code review domains\n\n"
            "### Evaluation Framework:\n"
            "- Controlled studies across real-world L2D tasks\n"
            "- Time-evolving coverage-accuracy manifold analysis\n"
            "- Statistical inference comparing AHO vs. fixed-threshold baselines\n"
            "- Causal mediation analysis to isolate adaptation impact\n"
            "- Robustness testing with perturbations (fatigue, concept drift, varying expert counts)\n\n"

            "Imagine you have a super smart robot friend who helps you with homework. Sometimes the robot is really sure about the answers and can do the work fast. But other times, the robot gets confused and might make mistakes.\n\n"
            "This app is like a game where you teach the robot when to ask for help from grown-up experts (like teachers) instead of trying to do everything alone. The robot learns from playing the game - it gets better at knowing when it's okay to work by itself and when it needs help.\n\n"
            "**The Robot's Job:**\n"
            "- The robot tries to answer questions about pictures (like finding sick spots in X-rays), legal papers, or computer code\n"
            "- For each question, the robot gives an answer AND says how sure it is (like \"I'm 80% sure this is right\")\n\n"
            "**The Expert humans:**\n"
            "- There are a few teacher experts who can also answer the questions\n"
            "- But teachers get tired after doing lots of work - they might make more mistakes when they're tired\n"
            "- The robot tries to share the work fairly so no teacher gets too tired\n\n"
            "**The Smart Rule:**\n"
            "- The robot has a \"confidence meter\" - if it's not confident enough, it asks a teacher for help\n"
            "- But this confidence level isn't fixed! The robot learns and changes it based on how well things are going\n"
            "- It's like adjusting how hard you try on a video game - sometimes you play easy mode, sometimes you try harder challenges\n\n"
            "**The Game:**\n"
            "- The robot plays many rounds, learning the best confidence level for different situations\n"
            "- It wants to do as much work as possible (so teachers don't get overworked) but also get good grades (high accuracy)\n"
            "- You can change settings like how many teachers there are, how tired they get, and what the robot cares about more\n\n"
            "The app shows graphs of how the robot improves over time, like watching your score get better in a game. It's teaching us how computers and people can work together better!"
